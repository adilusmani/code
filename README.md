# ReadMe for this Branch.
Some collection of codes that are used in data mining and data science related fields, developed by me 
(Data Science, Indiana University):

Artificial-Intelligence:
This folder contains programs in python, where I implemented KNN, Neural Nets, BFS, DFS, A*, Naive Baye's, HMM Viterbi, 
MCMC Gibs Sampling algorithms. The description of every program is returned above the specified program itself. 
Please check File to run program for each 
  1. Image Classifier - 
    File to run - orient.py
    Models used - Neural Nets, KNN
    Train_data - train-data.txt
    test_data - test-data.txt
    
  2. Maps -
    File to run - route.py
    City Data - road-segments.txt
    A* data - city-gps.txt
    
  3. Parts Of Speech tagger - 
    File to run - pos_solver.py
    Train_data - bc.train
    Test_data - bc.test

  4. Zacate_Auto_Player -
    File to run - zacate.py
    
  5. Solver_16 -
    File to run - solver16.py
    input_matrix_data - input

Algorithms:
  1. Selection Sort - selectionsort.java
  2. Quick sort - quicksort.java
  3. Merge Sort - mergersort.java
  4. Least Commmon Subsequence - LCS.java
  5. Huffman coding - Huffman.py
  6. Heap Sort - HeapSort.java
  7. Dijkstra path finding - dijkstra.py
  8. DFS - dfs.py (recurssion)
  9. Binary Search Tree - BinarySearchTree.java
  
Data Mining:
  1. Kmeans - kmean_test.R (Implementaion of K-means Algorithm, with number of clusters value(k), tow,l, where l is the 
      number of points the data to be allocated to.
      Data - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/
  2. K-L distance - kl.R (Calculates the KL distance)
  3. Data_mining/BUS_decoders/BUS_decoders/Code - has all the codes related to the project, for cleaning, merging the data.
    Please check Readme_Data.txt, Readme_code.txt and Report.pdf

Linear Regression -
    File to run - ml_assign_1.py
    Data - kc_house_data.gl
  
Distribution by Technologies:-<br />
  Python - Check for Artificial Intelligence Folder, dijkstra.py, and dfs.py
  R - Check for Data Mining Folder
  JAVA - Check for Algorithm folder and Data Mining- BetterCode.java
