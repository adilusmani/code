# codes
Some collection of codes that are used in data mining and data science related fields, developed by me 
(Data Science, Indiana University):

Artificial-Intelligence:
This folder contains programs in python, where I implemented KNN, Neural Nets, BFS, DFS, A*, Naive Baye's, HMM Viterbi, 
MCMC Gibs Sampling algorithms. The description of every program is returned above the specified program itself.
