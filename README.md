# ReadMe for this Branch.
Some collection of codes that are used in data mining and data science related fields, developed by me 
(Data Science, Indiana University):

Artificial-Intelligence:
This folder contains programs in python, where I implemented KNN, Neural Nets, BFS, DFS, A*, Naive Baye's, HMM Viterbi, 
MCMC Gibs Sampling algorithms. The description of every program is returned above the specified program itself. 
Please check File to run program for each <br />
  1. Image Classifier - <br />
    File to run - orient.py <br />
    Models used - Neural Nets, KNN <br />
    Train_data - train-data.txt <br />
    test_data - test-data.txt <br />
    
  2. Maps - <br />
    File to run - route.py <br />
    City Data - road-segments.txt <br />
    A* data - city-gps.txt <br />
    
  3. Parts Of Speech tagger - <br />
    File to run - pos_solver.py <br />
    Train_data - bc.train <br />
    Test_data - bc.test <br />

  4. Zacate_Auto_Player - <br />
    File to run - zacate.py
    
  5. Solver_16 - <br />
    File to run - solver16.py <br />
    input_matrix_data - input <br />

Algorithms: <br />
  1. Selection Sort - selectionsort.java
  2. Quick sort - quicksort.java
  3. Merge Sort - mergersort.java
  4. Least Commmon Subsequence - LCS.java
  5. Huffman coding - Huffman.py
  6. Heap Sort - HeapSort.java
  7. Dijkstra path finding - dijkstra.py
  8. DFS - dfs.py (recurssion)
  9. Binary Search Tree - BinarySearchTree.java
  
Data Mining: <br />
  1. Kmeans - kmean_test.R (Implementaion of K-means Algorithm, with number of clusters value(k), tow,l, where l is the 
      number of points the data to be allocated to. <br />
      Data - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/
  2. K-L distance - kl.R (Calculates the KL distance) 
  3. Data_mining/BUS_decoders/BUS_decoders/Code - has all the codes related to the project, for cleaning, merging the data. <br />
    Please check Readme_Data.txt, Readme_code.txt and Report.pdf

Machine Learning(Self Implementations):
1. Linear Regression - <br />
    ml_assign_1.py <br />
2. Ridge regression - <br />
    self_implement/rig_regression.py <br />
3. Lasso regression - <br/>
    lass.py
4. Time series - <br />
    predict_18april_2may.R
5. Bagging and Boosting(Adaboost) - <br />
    mytree.py<br />
6. Decision Tree - <br />
    mytree.py <br />

Practice folder is for the coding that I do in my spare time. <br />


Distribution by Technologies:-<br />
  Python - Check for Artificial Intelligence Folder, dijkstra.py, dfs.py and practice folder <br />
  R - Check for Data Mining Folder <br />
  JAVA - Check for Algorithm folder and Data Mining- BetterCode.java and practice folder <br />

Challenges:- <br />
  Noctober - Check model.ipnyb within Noctober Folder. Placed 3 winner on AnalyticsVidhya competition.<br />
  Telstra -  Check Telstra.ipnyb within Telstra challenge. <br />
